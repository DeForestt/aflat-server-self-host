    <p class="mb-4">
        AFlat is a modern, low-level programming language that provides developers with 
        fine-grained control over memory and execution while maintaining a minimalistic syntax. 
        It is designed for developers who prioritize efficiency, performance, and flexibility.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">Trust the Programmer Philosophy</h3>
    <p class="mb-4">
        Unlike many modern languages that enforce strict safety rules, AFlat follows a 
        <strong>"trust the programmer"</strong> philosophy. This means:
    </p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 text-gray-700">
        <li>Allows direct memory management and pointer arithmetic.</li>
        <li>Provides optional safety features for those who need them.</li>
        <li>Empowers developers with control rather than enforcing constraints.</li>
        <li>Encourages a balance between performance and safety based on the developerâ€™s needs.</li>
    </ul>
